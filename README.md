This Python script demonstrates the conversion of a dictionary called "menu" into a JSON format using the 'json' module. The "menu" dictionary holds information about various menu items, each having an assigned number, name, and price. The script's main purpose is to show how to convert this dictionary into a JSON format with proper indentation for improved readability.

The 'json.dumps()' function is utilized to convert the dictionary to a JSON string, and the 'indent' parameter is set to 4 to create a visually organized and indented JSON representation. The JSON representation of the "menu" dictionary is then printed to the console.

The 'if __name__ == "__main__":' block ensures that the 'main()' function is executed when the script is run directly, and it serves as the entry point for the script's execution. The script can be further extended with additional functionality beyond the JSON conversion, as indicated by the "Rest of your main function..." comment.
